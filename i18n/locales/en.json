TAN TAN TAN 🤪.<br />\n     😂 It is a lie, I'm a Software developer,<br />\n     I'm completely addicted to frontend and a user experience enthusiast.<br />\n     However, I think the backstage processes are amazing too, this way I am more enchanted with the\n     experience of developing than necessarily a specific part of development process.<br />\n     Recently I've been very interested in finance and investments in general, and I end up losing some\n     time studying about. My friends who tell you, we hardly ever spend time together again 😅 (Ah, there is also Corona).<br />\n     And I try to share my learnings on Youtube/Medium and anywhere I can.",
